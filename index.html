<h1>Starting Life As a College Student</h1>
<br>
<hr>
<p>Hii!,</p>
<p>My name is Fathima Nida and in this page,I would like to talk about how scary starting college can be.</p>
  <p>Leaving school behind and starting somewhere new can be daunting. One thing you should remember is that everyone else starting the college is in same position as you.
   So don't worry even if it feels scary at first,it is going to be a good ride ahead. Wish you all great start and a beautiful college life!!</p>
  <p>Also share your first day of college experiences below.</p>
